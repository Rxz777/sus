    <h1 class="article-title">Deploy to ECS with Fargate using Terraform</h1>
    <p class="text-article">“Everything can be code if you are brave enough”

    <p class="text-article">This was the mantra that I said to myself when I decided to take the leap into IaC. I
        previously gathered some
        experience within the AWS world on how to run a web application (both simple S3 hosting and with ECS), but it
        was always “clicked together” manually.</p>

    <p class="text-article">So the next natural step in evolution would be to build the infrastructure with the help of
        code, and Terraform
        seemed like the way to go.</p>


    <p class="text-article">As doing this without a clear purpose would only be half the fun, a small internal project
        became the starting
        point for my foray into the world of IaC.</p>
    <p class="text-article">The project in question was the automatic generation of business cards for finleap
        employees, without the need
        to have a designer create the print-ready PDF.</p>


    <p class="text-article">This article will not focus on the application itself - but as a side note: It's a simple
        Node.js server based
        on express, serving a React application, both bundled together in a Docker container.</p>
